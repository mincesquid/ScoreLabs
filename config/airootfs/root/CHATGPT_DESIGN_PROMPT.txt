PROMPT FOR CHATGPT/DALL-E - SECURITY LINUX DISTRO VISUAL DESIGN
==================================================================================

You are an expert UI/UX designer specializing in cybersecurity-themed operating systems and dark aesthetic interfaces. I need you to help design the visual elements for a security-focused Arch Linux distribution with KDE Plasma desktop environment.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This is an Arch-based penetration testing and security auditing distribution - similar to Kali Linux but with a unique visual identity that emphasizes both professionalism and the "glitch aesthetic" of modern cybersecurity culture.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

COLOR PALETTE (CRITICAL - USE EXACTLY THESE):
- Primary Red: #FF0033 (vibrant security alert red)
- Dark Red: #330000 (deep background red)
- Glitch Grey: #1a1a1a (primary dark background)
- Accent Grey: #2d2d2d (secondary backgrounds, panels)
- Text Primary: #dcdcdc (light grey for main text)
- Text Secondary: #787878 (disabled/inactive text)
- Pure Black: #000000 (for depth and shadows)
- Pure White: #ffffff (for high contrast elements and highlights)

AESTHETIC KEYWORDS:
- Glitchy/glitch art aesthetic (digital distortion, scan lines, RGB split)
- Cyberpunk undertones but professional, not overly neon
- Matrix-inspired but evolved beyond the 90s look
- Terminal/command-line culture references
- Security-focused (locks, shields, binary, hexadecimal patterns)
- Dark, mysterious, but still functional and readable
- Subtle animations and transitions, not distracting
- Professional enough for security work, cool enough to be distinctive

SPECIFIC VISUAL ELEMENTS NEEDED:

1. DESKTOP WALLPAPERS (4K resolution, 3840x2160):
   - Default wallpaper: Abstract glitch pattern with red accents
     * Use subtle RGB chromatic aberration effects
     * Incorporate hexadecimal or binary patterns
     * Dark background with red "data stream" effects
     * Subtle scan line overlay
     * Should not be busy - needs to be functional desktop background
   
   - Lock screen wallpaper: More aggressive glitch effect
     * Centered lock icon with glitch distortion
     * Red pulsing glow effect concept
     * "SECURED" or "SYSTEM LOCKED" text with glitch
     * More dramatic but still professional

     * Window buttons (minimize, maximize, close):
       + Minimal flat design
       + Close button: Red on hover
       + Maximize: Red outline on hover
       + Minimize: Red underscore on hover
   
   - Window shadows:
     * Subtle red glow for active windows
     * Standard dark shadow for inactive

5. PLASMA WIDGETS THEME:
   - System monitor widgets:
     * CPU/RAM/Network graphs in red
     * Dark backgrounds with red progress bars
     * Terminal-style monospace fonts for numbers
   
   - Security monitoring dashboard:
     * Real-time threat indicators
     * Log viewer with syntax highlighting (red for errors/alerts)
     * System integrity status display
     * Network connection monitor

6. LOGIN SCREEN (SDDM Theme):

   - Login box:
     * Semi-transparent dark panel
     * Red outline when focused
     * Username/password fields: Terminal-style
   - User avatar: Circular frame with red glow

TYPOGRAPHY:

Primary fonts:
- System UI: Hack, Fira Code, or Roboto Mono
- Terminal: Fira Code or Hack (with ligatures)
- Monospace for all technical elements
- Sans-serif for labels, readable at small sizes

Font weights:
- Regular for body text
- Medium for emphasis
- Bold for headers/titles (use sparingly)

IMPORTANT DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

1. FUNCTIONALITY FIRST: All visual effects must not impair usability
2. PERFORMANCE: Animations should be GPU-accelerated and smooth
3. ACCESSIBILITY: Maintain sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
4. PROFESSIONALISM: This is for security work - cool but not toy-like
5. CONSISTENCY: All elements follow the same design language
6. SUBTLETY: Glitch effects should be tasteful, not overwhelming
7. READABILITY: Text must be clear at all sizes
8. DARK-OPTIMIZED: Designed for extended use in dark environments

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:
- No excessive neon colors beyond the defined red accent
- No busy backgrounds that distract from work
- No extreme chromatic aberration that causes eye strain
- No rapid flashing or strobing effects
- No pixelated "retro" fonts that reduce readability
- No generic "hacker" clichés (falling green text, etc.)
- No overwrought 3D effects or skeuomorphism

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each element, provide:
1. Detailed written description
2. Color codes used (from palette above)
3. Specific design notes (spacing, sizing, effects)
4. Animation timing and easing functions
5. Implementation notes for KDE/Plasma/Qt

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
- Target users: Security professionals, penetration testers, system auditors
- Use case: Daily driver for security work, not just a demo
- Hardware: Assumes modern GPU with compositing support
- Screen: Optimized for 1080p and 4K displays
- Accessibility: Must work well in bright and dark environments

Generate comprehensive design specifications for all elements listed above, focusing on creating a cohesive, professional, and distinctive visual identity that sets this distribution apart from standard KDE installations while maintaining the functionality required for serious security work.

Include CSS/QML code snippets where applicable for implementing these designs in KDE Plasma.
